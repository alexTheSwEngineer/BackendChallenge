/**
 * Core implementation of the Event interface /Observer pattern.
 * <p>
 * It has pessimistic expectations about the listeners methods raising exceptions and is made deliberetly robust against exceptions.
 * It has however, optimistic expectations about listeners not halting, since it is executed on the callers thread.
 * This naive implementation keeps infinite event history which might prove to be an issue in busy systems. A sliding window solution may be more appropriate with high throughput systems.
